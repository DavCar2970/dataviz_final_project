The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find the datasets and project 1 report file including the HTML. This project is concerned with the traffic data in Minnesota, and discovers the correlation between the weather and traffic data.


## Project 02

In this project, I explored the datasets concerning Florida Lakes and houses in the West Roxbury area. Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.



## Project 03

In this project, I explored text data from comments from rate my professor. In addition, I delved into making data visualizations about weather data, specifically looking at max temperatures for each month.


### Moving Forward

What I learned is how to create several varieties of data visualizations, and how to further improve them with labels, colors, and visualization principles such as avoiding chart junk. I am not sure if I will continue data visualization as I am a Computer Science major but if the opportunity comes by, data visualizations may come in handy someday.
